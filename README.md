Unsolved problems / hurdles:
The most challenging aspect of this project was configuring the hubot and connecting properly with slack. Once it was configured, writing the scripts and plugins was fun and totally doable! Taking this project to the next level with more in depth javascript code and bringing the scripts to other chatrooms will be my biggest challenge over the next two weeks.
